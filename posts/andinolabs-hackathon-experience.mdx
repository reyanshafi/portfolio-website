## The Beginning: 26 Hours to Build Something Amazing

When I heard about the **Andinolabs Hackathon 2024**, I knew this was my chance to push boundaries, collaborate with talented developers, and build something that could make a real difference. Little did I know that in just 26 hours, our team would create **Price Wise** - an AI-powered price comparison platform that would become one of my most technically challenging projects.

---

## The Challenge: E-commerce Price Transparency

The problem was clear: online shoppers struggle to find the best deals across multiple platforms. Manually comparing prices is time-consuming and often leads to missed opportunities. We needed to create a solution that would:

- **Automatically track prices** across different e-commerce sites
- **Provide real-time updates** when prices change
- **Offer intelligent recommendations** based on user preferences
- **Present data in a clean, user-friendly interface**

---

## The Team: Four Minds, One Vision

Our team of four brought diverse skills to the table:
- **Frontend Development** (React.js & Next.js)
- **Backend Architecture** (Node.js & Firebase)
- **Web Scraping & Automation** (Playwright & Cheerio)
- **UI/UX Design** (Tailwind CSS)

The beauty of hackathons lies in how quickly strangers can become collaborators, each contributing their expertise toward a common goal.

---

## The Tech Stack: Choosing the Right Tools

### Frontend: React.js + Next.js
We chose Next.js for its:
- **Server-side rendering** for better SEO
- **Built-in API routes** for seamless backend integration
- **Optimized performance** out of the box

### Backend: Node.js + Firebase
Firebase provided:
- **Real-time database** for instant price updates
- **Authentication** for user management
- **Scalable hosting** without server management overhead

### Web Scraping: Playwright + Cheerio
The core functionality required:
- **Playwright** for browser automation and dynamic content
- **Cheerio** for server-side HTML parsing
- **Cron Jobs** for scheduled price monitoring

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
For rapid UI development with:
- **Utility-first classes** for quick styling
- **Responsive design** without media queries
- **Consistent design system** across components

---

## The Development Process: Racing Against Time

### Day 1: Foundation and Architecture
- **Hour 1-4:** Team formation and project planning
- **Hour 5-12:** Setting up the development environment
- **Hour 13-20:** Building core scraping functionality
- **Hour 21-26:** Implementing the React frontend, Firebase integration, and final deployment

The compressed timeline meant we had to be incredibly efficient with our development process, prioritizing core functionality and seamless team collaboration.

---

## Technical Challenges We Overcame

### 1. **Dynamic Content Scraping**
Many e-commerce sites load prices dynamically with JavaScript. We solved this using Playwright's browser automation:

```javascript
// Simplified example of our scraping approach
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto(productUrl);
await page.waitForSelector('.price-selector');
const price = await page.textContent('.price-selector');
```

### 2. **Rate Limiting and Anti-Bot Measures**
We implemented:
- **Rotating user agents** to avoid detection
- **Request delays** to respect server limits
- **Proxy rotation** for distributed scraping

### 3. **Real-time Price Updates**
Using Firebase's real-time database, we achieved:
- **Instant notifications** when prices drop
- **Live dashboard updates** without page refresh
- **Efficient data synchronization** across all clients

---

## The Results: What We Built

**Price Wise** became a fully functional platform featuring:

### Core Features
- ✅ **Real-time price tracking** across multiple platforms
- ✅ **Automated data collection** with smart scraping
- ✅ **Scheduled price updates** via cron jobs
- ✅ **AI-powered deal recommendations**
- ✅ **User-friendly comparison interface**
- ✅ **Mobile-responsive design**

### Technical Achievements
- **Scalable architecture** ready for production
- **Clean, maintainable code** with proper documentation
- **Responsive UI** that works on all devices
- **Real-time data synchronization**
- **Automated testing** for reliability

## Lessons Learned: Beyond the Code

### 1. **Team Collaboration is Everything**
The hackathon taught me that technical skills alone don't win - it's how well you work with others under pressure. We used:
- **Git for version control** with clear branching strategies
- **Slack for communication** with dedicated channels
- **Figma for design collaboration** and quick mockups

### 2. **MVP Mindset**
With limited time, we had to prioritize ruthlessly:
- **Core functionality first** - price comparison before nice-to-haves
- **User experience over perfection** - smooth UX beats pixel-perfect design
- **Deployment early** - getting something live quickly for testing

### 3. **Documentation Matters**
Even in a fast-paced environment, we maintained:
- **Clear commit messages** for code tracking
- **README files** for easy setup
- **API documentation** for team coordination

---

## The Technology Deep Dive

### Web Scraping Architecture
Our scraping system was built with reliability in mind:

```javascript
// Cron job for scheduled price updates
const schedule = require('node-cron');

schedule.schedule('0 */6 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('Starting price update job...');
  await updateAllPrices();
  console.log('Price update completed');
});
```

### Firebase Integration
Real-time updates were crucial for user experience:

```javascript
// Real-time price monitoring
const priceRef = firebase.database().ref('prices');
priceRef.on('value', (snapshot) => {
  const prices = snapshot.val();
  updateUI(prices);
});
```

---

## Deployment and Going Live

We deployed **Price Wise** to Vercel for:
- **Fast global CDN** for optimal performance
- **Automatic deployments** from GitHub
- **Environment variable management** for API keys
- **Custom domain** support for professional presentation

**Live Demo:** [pricewiseweb.vercel.app](https://pricewiseweb.vercel.app)

## Reflections: What This Experience Taught Me

### Technical Growth
- **Full-stack development** under extreme time pressure
- **Web scraping** and automation techniques
- **Real-time applications** with Firebase
- **Team-based development** workflows

### Soft Skills
- **Problem-solving** under tight deadlines

## Final Thoughts: The Hackathon Spirit

The Andinolabs hackathon reminded me why I love development - it's not just about writing code, it's about solving problems and creating value. In 26 hours, we went from strangers with an idea to a team with a working product.

The experience taught me that with the right mindset, tools, and team, anything is possible. Whether you're a student, professional, or hobbyist, hackathons offer a unique opportunity to push your limits and create something amazing.

**To future hackathon participants:** Don't just focus on winning - focus on learning, building, and connecting with fellow developers. The real prize is the growth you'll experience and the relationships you'll build.
